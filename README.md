### Hi!

My name is Renata, I am a MIPT student and I'm interested in Data Science. I took a data science Yandex course, and here are some of my projects that I've done during my training and during hackatons. I continue to deepen my knowledge in this field by participating in hackathons, competitions on Kaggle and various ML Meetups.

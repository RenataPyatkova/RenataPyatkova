# Hi, I’m Renata

I am a bioinformatician with a strong background in machine learning, data science, and molecular biology.  
My main focus is applying computational methods to transcriptomic and multi-omics data to uncover biological insights, particularly in neurobiology and disease research.  

Alongside my bioinformatics projects, I also work on machine learning and deep learning applications, combining my technical expertise with biological knowledge to address real-world challenges.
